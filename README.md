## Hi, I'm Akshara 👩‍🔬👋

I’m a Biomanufacturing graduate passionate about **science, healthcare, and data** (yes — *data!*). I recently discovered how powerful data can be in understanding processes, improving quality, and driving innovation in life sciences.

Here on GitHub, I’ll be sharing my projects, dashboards, and experiments — all from my *scientific and problem-solving perspective*.


🔭 I’m currently working on
- Building **Power BI dashboards** from biomanufacturing datasets  
- Exploring **Python for data analysis and process insights**

🚀 Always learning, always experimenting — and always open to connecting!
